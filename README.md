# New-SSLCert
To create a new SSL Cert on Windows with SHA256 or ECC, you have to follow a wizard with lots of steps.

To make this easier, I've created this script so you can create the CSR with just one window.

This is an HTA (HTML Application) file and can be run directly on Windows.

If you want to run this from the commandline, you can use mshta.exe New-SSLCert.hta
